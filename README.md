# Calculator Website
created a simple calculator using HTML, CSS & Javascript. branching off from the skeletal project i've done from Academind's Javascript Course. the logic and code might be a little overcomplicated as this my first time ever having used javascript in a project, if not my first day of ever having learned javascript.

## UI Inspiration
this interface for the calculator is completely based off of [Rico Smith's design on Dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/10903449-Daily-UI-004-Calculator). however, i hard coded the css on my own.
